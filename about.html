  <h1 class="abt-header">Hi.</h1>
  <p class="abt-subheader">My name is Dave Gamache and I'm a designer.</p>
  <div class="abt-body">
    <p>I work at Twitter in my hometown of San Francisco and spend my days sketching, designing in Photoshop, 
      writing scalable HTML/CSS/JS, listening to users and noodling with my team on the future of the Twitter. 
      When I'm not in the office, I spend my time exploring the city and beyond, adventuring in the wilderness, 
      learning about the world, working on tiny side projects, writing, romancing the lovely 
      <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ashleybatz">@ashleybatz</a>, reading trashy pre-teen novels, listening 
      to music and playing games. And eating. I love eating. Feel free to hit me up on
